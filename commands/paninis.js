The word panini comes from the Italian word for sandwich, panino. The plural of which is panini. By saying paninis you are effectively saying sandwicheses. And thus insulting anyone with a damn brain. If you plan to keep spreading your idiocy, go to the healing crystal store, maybe they’ll learn something. Oh, by the way the bot is working desu. Yare yare my head...')
